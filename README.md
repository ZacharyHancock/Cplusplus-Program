# Cplusplus-Program

-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was to take in an input field in this case a grocery store's inventory and store it into a map then prompt the user for input with a menu to perform actions such as listing all items or specific items. It helped solve the problem of quickly accessing a store inventory, it also backs up the inventory to an output file which helps with redundancy for inventory as well.
  
-What did you do particularly well?
  I feel like what I did particularly well with this project was my use of maps. As I've never implemented a program with them before I feel like this being my first use with them I came to understand them easily and utilize them well. They are quite simple in retrospect they are just a container with a key and a value that are associated together.
  
-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I feel like I could've made a function to run through the map so I wouldn't have to implement the same code multiple times within separate use cases. It would make it more efficient as there would be fewer lines of code plus reading code as function calls are way easier to understand than a block of code.

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I think what I came to learn something new again would be my effort to format the histogram so it creates a nicely aligned chart. The simple use of cout without further modifications didn't suit the purpose of a histogram. So I took to the internet and was able to learn how to use set to fit my needs. I have always previously used online resources such as peer support through Stackoverflow or the actual coding reference library like on [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/reference/)

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Skills that will always be useful on any project will be the implementation of input validation. Any program can cause issues if the coder doesn't check the user's inputs, but with this implementation, the coder can make sure to keep the user within the correct bounds.

-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made my program maintainable and adaptable by adding the ability to easily scale the prompts with the use of SENTINEL which is pretty much the condition of termination, this implementation I learned from my professor and will continue to use it. Readability I helped make by creating easily distinguishable functions as well as inline comments to explain what blocks of codes or function's purposes are.
